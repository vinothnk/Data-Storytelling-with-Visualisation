# Data Storytelling with Visualisation
 

***Problem Statement***

We assumed that WHO stakeholders asked us to do a visualisation for Covid cases worldwide.

***To showcase the widespread of Covid throughout the world from January 2020 till August 2021.***

***How does vaccination rates share a collinearity between deaths and new cases in a country?***

Here we have Malta with a 89.58% vaccination rate by July 2021. As we can see in the top right pane, Malta began actively vaccinating its citizens slightly before March 2021.
As the percentage of citizens being vaccinated increases, the number of new deaths and new cases decline with a slight surge of new cases in May-June 2021. Nevertheless, it shows that the vaccination rates decreases the number of new deaths and number of new cases.

To confirm this theory, we compared Malta's vaccination rate together with Italy, which was one of the worst hit countries with Covid.
As you can see, Italy started rolling out the vaccinations slightly before March 2021. However since they were a country with a lot of covid cases, it took a while before
the number of new deaths and new cases eventually slowed down as the vaccination rate increased.

***Taking a look at the rise of Covid by continents***

***Why is Taiwan different from the rest of the other countries?***

Taiwan has been different compared to other countries as their death rate and number of new cases has been well below the worldwide average. This is due to their level of
stringency in terms of what they have been doing to segregate the infected from the uninfected.

Attached is the Oxford Coronavirus Government Response Tracker and the list of 9 metrics to measure the Stringency Index.

***Italy and levels of stringency***

As we know, Italy was one of the hardest hit countries in the world with Covid with the rate of new cases and deaths increasing in an alarming rate on a daily basis.
The country increased the safe distance measurements by increasing the stringecy levels to a high level in November 2020 where the rate of new cases were at a level of
1.285.

And within 1 month, the average new cases rate dropped by half. This is due to the high levels of safe distance measures applied and with the slow increases in vaccinations throughout the country.
